Inkwise is an AI-powered whiteboard designed for students to use while they are studying. The key features include:

- A multi-device cloud-based whiteboard experience.
- An AI chatbot available to assist students and provide tips as they work.
- A wide variety of tools and features to allow students to be creative.

The goal is to provide students with assistance rather than answers, like a tutor would. This allows the user to learn and understand what they are studying.
 
Built for UTS Software Innovation Studio Spring 2024.
